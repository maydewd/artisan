# Artisan - Executive Summary

## Overview

When people travel they love to immerse themselves completely in the culture, such as trying the local food and drink specialties and going to the most popular local hangouts.  When people leave a given destination they like to take something with them to remember the trip.  Brian Anderson, who came up with this app idea, is a frequent traveler.  Like many others he was looking for a way to purchase a meaningful item before leaving a destination; something nicer than a cheap, unoriginal knick knacks and souvenirs.  From this desire the Storkd app idea was born.  Storkd is a geo-location mobile application that connects local artisans with travelers and community consumers.  It will allow consumers to purchase hand-woven rugs from New Mexico, paintings from New York, and jewelry from the West Coast directly from local artist.

The Storkd name comes from the concept of delivering a beautiful package.  The artisans, the stork, will be able to share their craft and items to the world.  This concept of this interaction, of connecting the artist directly to the consumer, will allow the consumer to get art pieces that are not only beautiful, but also have a face and story behind them.

## Target Users

## Value

The local art scene will be transformed by this app. There are two main target users of the app, both of which will be influenced differently: artists and purchasers.

For artists this app will provide an avenue for exposure and sales.  The app will provide artists to post their art as well as their artistic process (in the form of pictures and videos).  Having a central collection of their work, in addition to the geo-location feature, will allow local artists to gain a following.  Consumers will feel more like they know the artists (the seller) on a more personal item.  In this way the app will foster a community, rather than *just* a place for sales and purchases.  Additionally, the geo-location feature will constantly introduce artists to fresh, new clientele.

One effect of this app on consumers is quite obvious- it will provide a place for consumers to *consume*.  This app will fill the missing market of connecting consumers which local artists, whose art is often hard to find. Second, this app will provide lovers of art a place to view art and interact with art.  Using the app in this sense more closely resembles social media, opposed to e-commerce.  We could easily tie in Functionality of allowing user to post art they like to other social media sites, further spreading exposure. 

Overall, I think this app will connect artists to art lovers near them, thus strengthening the local art community, as well as increasing consumption of local artists amongst travels.  Both of these effects should bolster the local art community.

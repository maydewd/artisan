# Artisan - Executive Summary

## Overview

When people travel they love to immerse themselves completely in the culture, such as trying the local food and drink specialties.  When these travelers leave they like to take a piece of this culture with them, in the for of a souvenir. Brian Anderson, a frequent traveler, was looking for a way to purchase meaningful items before leaving a destination; something nicer than a cheap, unoriginal knick knacks.  From this desire the Storkd app idea was born.  Storkd is a geo-location mobile application that connects local artisans with travelers and community consumers.  It will allow consumers to purchase hand-woven rugs from New Mexico, paintings from New York, and jewelry from the West Coast directly from local artist.

The Storkd name comes from the concept of delivering a beautiful package.  The artisans, the storks, will be able to share their craft and items directly with the consumer, allowing the consumer to get art pieces that are not only beautiful, but also have a face and story behind them.

## Target Users

## Value

This app has two main audiences: artists (sellers) and art lovers (consumers).  This app will attempt to unite these two groups who benefit from each other.

For artists this app will provide an avenue for exposure and sales.  The app will provide artists to post their art as well as their artistic process (in the form of pictures and videos).  Having a central collection of their work, in addition to the geo-location feature, will allow local artists to gain a following, leading to sales.  

For art lovers this app will fill a missing market of local art, which is often hard to find. However, the app will also provide a place to view art and interact with artist.  This mix of social media and e-commerce will foster a stronger relationships between artists and the local community, allowing art lovers to become more involved in the art scene as well as purchase unique, local art.

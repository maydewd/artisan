# Storkd - User Tasks

### Overview

Our app is a geolocation app that connects travelers to local artists.  As a buyer, on this app you should be able to view art based on search preferences, react to the art and signify your interest, and contact the seller directly.  As a seller, you should be able to post you art with a story, description, and starting selling price.  On our app there is no distinction between pure buyer and sellers, as artists are encouraged to view and purchase other art pieces and travelers are encouraged to to post their art pieces.  

There are several features you should expect to see in our app:
* Resister as a user
* Login in via Facebook
* View local posts
* Edit your search settings
* Post art to the app
* Edit and delete your posts

We expect you to explore all these features.  However, don't be limited by any of the tasks; feel free to explore.  We are looking forward to any of the feedback you might have, such as, but not limited to:
* Usability
    * Did it take you too long to find something?
    * Where you confused by any of the text or images?
    * Did any interactions take you somewhere you did not expect?
    * Is there something you wanted to do, but couldn't
* Aesthetic
    * How did you like the overview look of the app?
    * Did you like the colors?
    * How was the size of everything?

To access the app you will need to load TestFlight from the App Store (iOS).  From here we will provide further information on how to access our specific app and give your feedback!  Once the app is up and running you can create a Storkd account or access the app through Facebook.

Below are a series of task for you to complete, which in total should take about 45 minutes.   Please navigate through the app as you please and feel free to experiment!

# Artisan- Project Plan

# Overall

We intend to deliver an iOS application that connects local artists to travelers and their community.

The following are features we find essential or core to this goal:

* Login authentication with Facebook as well as the option for email authentication
* Geolocation technology- artwork displayed to user based on location
* Editing of art search preference settings (radius, price, type)
* The ability for users to respond to the art displayed in their area and add certain pieces to a queue for later viewing
* In app messaging
* A central place where users can display the art they have added to the app

The following are features we regard as wish-list components:

* In app purchases (PayPal)
* Video integration

## Backend

## Front-end

## Client side

We expect relatively few resources from the client.  Our app will be light on text and necessary images.  We have already received a first version of the logo.  In the future we will need:

* Icons (if the client prefers we not use third part open source image libraries)
* Names of screens (examples: StorkFront, My bundle)
* Artwork (images) to use as data to populate the app
* User testers (artists Edreys should know & business partners from Brian)
* Further clarifications as necessary

The two largest components of this list is the artwork and user testers.  We expect to get the artwork some time during the first sprint as Edreys should have images of his art readily available.   The testing component is described in greater detail below.

## Testing

We realize the user testers will require more effort and time from the clients to provide.  Ideally we would like to do user testing through the app development process.  We will notify the clients as soon as possible to put this in motion.  Reasonably we expect a pool of user testers by the end of Sprint 3 (when the core features of the app are complete).

# Sprint 1 (Mockup UI with Navigation) - Complete

We used the proto.io software to deliver create a UI that we believe showcases the desired functionality of the app.  This mockup UI can be accessed using the following link:

# Artisan- Project Design

Ryan St.Pierre, David Maydew, Sung-Hoon Kim

### User Stories

### Professional Artist (Power User)

As a professional artist I can create a profile displaying any images of art I have made, plans for art I can custom make, and videos of my artistic process that I desire. These postings will be viewed by local users/travelers who will be able to contact me directly through the app. Additionally, I will be able to create a profile describing my specialties and any other information I feel relevant about my career that users will be able to access.

### Amateur Artist

I will be able to post some of my artwork, which I consider a passion more than a primary career, on the app.  The app will allow me to share this interest I have with others.  Based on the interest I might consider taking art more seriously.   Also, this app will provide me a door into the art community, connecting me to other artists as well as allowing me to view other art pieces for inspiration.

### Traveler

I will use the app when I travel to connect me to local artists.  I will search the app for items I am interested, connect directly to the artists, and leave the trip with an art piece I love.

### Art Enthusiast (Power User)

I will use the app to make constant purchases.  I may be an art curator or own a storefront that sells independent art.  Thus, my primary purpose is the purchase of art and possibly fostering long term **business** relationships with artists.

### Casual Local Art Consumer

I am not a curator or traveler but like to check out unique, local art items.  I will spend most of my time on the app browsing, only purchasing the items I like a lot.  I might also browse the app to find cool art works to share with my friends (through pictures or social media means).

### Team Organization

We plan on rotating roles every sprint (approx. every 2 weeks).  However, a description of the initial plan for the structure of the team is included below.

**Roles**

Business Analyst: Ryan St.Pierre

As business analyst Ryan will be the main point of contact with the client.  He will draft all e-mails (including agendas) and coordinate meeting times.  Coordination also includes the exchanging of resources, both from client to dev team and dev team to client. It is also Ryan's focus to ensure the client's desires are proper communicated and represented to the team.  

*Note: Although Ryan is current assigned as Business Analyst the client should feel comfortable reaching out to any of the team members*

Technical Lead:
primary- David Maydew secondary - Sung-Hoon Kim

David Maydew should be the point of contact for any technical questions.  Any question from the client starting with "How feasible is it to..." should be directed to David.  

David should also do the research on the best approach for technical solutions.  He should organize the approach and direct the rest of the team regarding technical decisions (after considering his research and input from the rest of the team).

*Note: We feel that the technical aspects of this project can consume a lot of time.  We feel investigating solutions for social media & pay-pal incorporation could be particularly time consuming.  For this reason we have designated Sung-Hoon as the secondary to this role.  His main role is to aid in the research of multiple solutions*

Scrum Master: Ryan St.Pierre

Ryan's job to ensure the team is on task with regard to the Sprint plan drafted prior to the Sprint. This includes reaching out to the necessary resources when roadblocks are encountered.

Quality Assurance: Sung-Hoon Kim

The client should reach out to Sung-Hoon regarding any questions on the robustness or completeness of a certain feature.  Sung-Hoon should be aware of all current known bugs and draft solutions for their resolution.

**Back-end vs Front-end**

David Maydew has the most experience with setting up a server/database system.  For this reason he will be responsible for taking point on setting up the server, database, and the proper connections.  Sung-Hoon has experience with Javascript and will take point on the front-end.

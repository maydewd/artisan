### User Stories

### Professional Artist (Power User)

As a professional artist I can create a profile displaying any images of art I have made, plans for art I can custom make, and videos of my artistic process that I desire. These postings will be viewed by local users/travelers who will be able to contact me directly through the app. Additionally, I will be able to create a profile describing my specialties and any other information I feel relevant about my career that users will be able to access.

### Amateur Artist

I will be able to post some of my artwork, which I consider a passion more than a primary career, on the app.  The app will allow me to share this interest I have with others.  Based on the interest I might consider taking art more seriously.   Also, this app will provide me a door into the art community, connecting me to other artists as well as allowing me to view other art pieces for inspiration.

### Traveler

I will use the app when I travel to connect me to local artists.  I will search the app for items I am interested, connect directly to the artists, and leave the trip with an art piece I love.

### Art Enthusiast (Power User)

I will use the app to make constant purchases.  I may be an art curator or own a storefront that sells independent art.  Thus, my primary purpose is the purchase of art and possibly fostering long term **business** relationships with artists.

### Casual Local Art Consumer

I am not a curator or traveler but like to check out unique, local art items.  I will spend most of my time on the app browsing, only purchasing the items I like a lot.  I might also browse the app to find cool art works to share with my friends (through pictures or social media means).

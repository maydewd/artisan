# How To Guide

### Register Locally

From the login screen of the app tap the Sign Up bottom.  Enter the necessary information such as username, password, and profile image.  You can grab the profile image from your phone's local camera roll or take a photo on the spot (photos with square dimensions work best). In addition to this information you need to set your default preferences.  These are the original search settings that will filter the art posts you see in the app.  A further description of each preference is given below:

* Discover radius: this is the range in which you will be able to see posts.
* Price range: this is the range of prices that posts shown to you will have.
* See my posts: if this is selected as true (switch to on/green) posts you have made will show up on your discover feed.
* See down voted posts:  if this is selected as true (switch to on/green) you will see posts in your discover feed that you have previously down voted (thumbs downed).

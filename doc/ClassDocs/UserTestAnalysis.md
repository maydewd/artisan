# User Test Analysis

### General

In general the feedback regarding the UI was positive, particularly in regards to intuitive navigation and simplistic design.  Many comment were made on small UI changes, such as photos stretching weirdly and color scheme changes, rather than huge bugs.  

### Unintuitive Design Identified

There are several instances where users found the design unintuitive.  They are listed below:

* Saving in the Discover Settings - several users expected their changes to discover settings to be saved upon selecting back, even if they had not clicked save.  
* Feedback in the Register screen - users expected the text fields to be validated dynamically and expected this feedback to be provided in some manner.
* Scrolling - one user expected to be able to scroll in the New Post screen when the keyboard is open.

### Bugs

* Unable to exit the New Post page when keyboard is opened.
* Able to swipe to screens (popping) in a non-desirable way. 

### Aesthetics

**Positives**

* Simplicity - feels clean and not cluttered.

**Suggested changes**

* Darker shade of pink.
* Bolder buttons (particularly at the bottom of screens).
* Be consistent with side-by-side buttons (either side-by-side or on top/bottom, not both)

We used a variety of 3rd party libraries in our app.  All of these dependencies are listed in the "package.json" file under the mobile folder. These dependencies can be added with the Node Package Manager (npm) by running the command “npm install”

**DEV dependencies**

The dev dependencies listed in the packages.json file are Jest and Babel, both of which are needed to run the test suit.

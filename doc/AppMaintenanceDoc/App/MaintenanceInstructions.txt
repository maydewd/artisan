**Maintenance Instructions**

*Changing server URL*

If the server URL is changed or the paths are changed the config file in "mobile/config/Server.js" needs to be changed.  In this document you will find all the URLs in the app.

*Update App Logo - iOS*

1. Generate the different size logos necessary using the following tool: https://makeappicon.com/.  It is necessary to have all the required logo sizes.  This resource will return a folder with the right app icon sizes (if desired generate this folder any way you like - the above resource is just one that worked well for us).
2. Replace the AppIcon.appiconset folder with the folder you generated in step 1 in the “/mobile/ios/Storkd/Images.xcassets.”

*Change Default Launch/Splash Screen - iOS*

Under “/mobile/ios/Storkd/Images.xcassets” add a folder called LaunchImage.launchimage that contains the desired launch image at the proper sizes.  The same tool from step 1 of “Update App Logo - iOS” can be used for this.

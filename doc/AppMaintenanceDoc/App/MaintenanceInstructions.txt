**Maintenance Instructions**Im

* Changing server URL *

If the server URL is changed or the paths are changed the config file in "mobile/config/Server.js" needs to be changed.  In this document you will find all the URLs in the app.

* Update App Logo *

1. Generate the different size logos necessary using the following tool: https://makeappicon.com/.  It is necessary to have all the required logo sizes.  This resource will return a folder with the right app icon sizes (if desired generate this folder any way you like - the above resource is just one that worked well for us).
2. Replace the AppIcon.appiconset folder with the folder you generated in step 1 in the “/mobile/ios/Storkd/Images.xcassets.”

* Change Default Splash Screen *
